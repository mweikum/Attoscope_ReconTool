# Attoscope_ReconTool
MATLAB tool for reconstructing the longitudinal profile of an electron beam from measured or simulated data of a streaking diagnostic device consisting of a laser modulator and RF transverse deflecting cavity

The following files are available for download:
- Attoscope_Analysis_GUI_v5_4_5.m: main MATLAB script used for beam profile reconstruction, requires constants.m to run
- constants.m: defines a set of physical constants required for the calculations in Attoscope_Analysis_GUI_v5_4_5.m
- Attoscope_Beam_Image_Analysis_v5_4_Documentation.pdf: documentation file with additional information and references regarding the reconstruction tool and the diagnostic technique
- SampleDistribution1.zip: zip-directory with a set of example files to test the reconstruction tool with
